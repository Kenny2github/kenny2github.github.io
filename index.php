	<h1 id="Programming">Me programming-wise</h1>
	<p>I'm best with Python programming, but I love working with Scratch (because of the simplicity and also to hack it) and I mostly use HTML and JavaScript nowadays since it's hard to find places where Python is called for and because I'm focusing on being a Scratch Wiki editor. I'm still best at Python though.</p>
	<p>I've worked with Minecraft redstone for six to seven years by now (2017), and I've played Undertale for just over a year. I hacked my SAVE file on my first playthrough, of course.</p>
	<p>I know Scratch, Python, HTML (obviously), JavaScript, CSS, MSDOS, PHP <sup class="note">[note]<div>Thanks to making a wiki with MediaWiki</div></sup> and bits of many other languages.</p>
	<h1 id="Quotes">Favorite Quotes</h1>
	<blockquote>
		<p>No one in the world can change Truth. What we can do and should do is to seek truth and to serve it when we have found it. The real conflict is the inner conflict. Beyond armies of occupation and the hecatombs of extermination camps, there are two irreconcilable enemies in the depth of every soul: good and evil, sin and love. And what use are the victories on the battlefield if we ourselves are defeated in our innermost personal selves?</p>
