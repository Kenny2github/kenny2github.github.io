			<h2>PPHP 3.0.0</h2>
			<p>Changes in this release:</p>
			<pre class="code">+The database is now stored in a single file (~/.pphp/__DATABASE__.json or %appdata%/.pphp/__DATABASE__.json), with each server's database being stored under one database key.
 +This means that when you first run your server, you will be prompted for a database key to store this server's data under. If the root is changed, you will be prompted again - but you can easily specify the same db key to continue using the data stored there.
 +To store the db key, a hidden file (.pphp-config) will be created directly under the root directory. This file simply contains the database key.
*The "do" function now requires two arguments (but no more): html and server. "html" should be the content of the page; "server" should be the server instance.
+The actual (recommended use) server built-in now uses the "thread" module instead of "threading" (although it still uses threading for its lock object).
 +The actual server built-in can now actually stop each individual port. Just enter the port number into the console to stop the server on that port.
 -This however means that IDLE can't handle the module anymore when run directly - always run from the console.
-Clean up and bugfixes</pre>
